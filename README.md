# MPLS Network Deployment

## Project Objective
Designed and deployed a Multi-Protocol Label Switching (MPLS) network to connect offices across two cities, ensuring secure and seamless communication.

## My Role
- **Network Design**: Created a robust MPLS architecture using Cisco technology to enhance inter-office communication.
- **Implementation**: Configured network devices to ensure secure data transfer across multiple sites.
- **Testing & Optimization**: Established a test environment to evaluate the impact of the network on business applications.

## Tools & Technologies
- **Hardware**: Cisco routers and switches.
- **Protocols**: MPLS, GRE, and IP-Sec VPNs for secure communication.
- **Monitoring Tools**: Wireshark for analyzing and optimizing network traffic.

## Results
- Enhanced inter-office communication and data transfer security.
- Achieved **95% system uptime** across all connected offices.
- Streamlined network operations, improving efficiency by **35%**.

## Key Challenges
- Coordinated with teams in two cities to ensure smooth deployment.
- Overcame hardware and environmental constraints to establish secure connections.

## Repository Details
This repository contains:
- **Configuration Files**: Sample configurations for MPLS setup.
- **Monitoring Scripts**: Example scripts for network performance analysis.
- **Documentation**: Step-by-step guides for deploying and testing MPLS networks.
